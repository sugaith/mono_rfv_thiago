@article{Crespo,
    abstract = {Abstract Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is the most widely established mesh-free method which has been used in several fields as astrophysics, solids mechanics and fluid dynamics. In the particular case of computational fluid dynamics, the model is beginning to reach a maturity that allows carrying out detailed quantitative comparisons with laboratory experiments. Here the state-of-the-art of the classical SPH formulation for free-surface flow problems is described in detail. This is demonstrated using dam-break simulations in 2-D and 3-D. The foundations of the method will be presented using different derivations based on the method of interpolants and on the moving least-squares approach. Different methods to improve the classic SPH approach such as the use of density filters and the corrections of the kernel function and its gradient are examined and tested on some laboratory cases. 2010 International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research.},

abstract = {In this paper, based on weakly compressible smoothed particles hydrodynamics (WCSPH), we present a method for simulating high quality fluid. We propose a new pressure equation to reduce time overhead, speed up convergence towards small density fluctuations and allow for a larger time step than that of traditional approaches. And based on the new equation, we introduce a new adaptive time-stepping approach that automatically adapts the time step according to each particle current individual time step, thus improving the efficiency of computation and contributing much to a real-time particle fluid simulation. For real-time simulation, we make full use of CPU and GPU in a combined way to build a parallel platform, namely Multi-GPU platform. And optimization of the platform design is made to run a simulation with realistic visual effects in real time.},
